We are building a web interface to a resume parser and tokenization tool. It will allow an orgnanization to collect and store resumes from applicants and organize them so that they can be queried by keyword. The primary users for this application will be organizations looking to recruit new talent. We hope that this application will help smooth the process applicants go through when applying to a company. Currently, people often need to submit their resume as a PDF and then resubmit most of that same data through smaller different fields. We hope to fix this such that people will only need to submit their resumes as PDFs.

We are focusing on the data storage and server-side requirements for this assignment.
